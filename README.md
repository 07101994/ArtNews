The most important piece of the example is the use of a modified version of [Xamarin.Plugin.SharedTransitions](https://github.com/Evolutionlab/Xamarin.Plugin.SharedTransitions) by Giampaolo Gabba. The changes are:
- Added more page transitions: Flip, SlideFromLeft, SlideFromRight, SlideFromTop and SlideFromBottom.
- Small code fixes.

All the changes (and some more as support to shared element transitions of more Xamarin.Forms controls) will be added to the library using PR.
